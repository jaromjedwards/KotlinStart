Overview
As a software engineer striving to enhance my skills and knowledge, I developed a task manager application using Kotlin. This project aimed to explore the Kotlin language syntax, particularly focusing on its features such as data classes, file I/O operations, and basic control flow.

The task manager application allows users to register, login, create tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and view their task list through a command-line interface. Through this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of Kotlin and practice implementing basic software functionalities.

Useful Websites
During the development of this project, the following websites proved to be helpful:

Kotlin Documentation - Official documentation for Kotlin language features and APIs.

In the future, I plan to address the following aspects to improve the task manager application:

Implement encryption for user passwords to enhance security.
Add error handling for user input to improve user experience and application robustness.
Enhance the user interface for better readability and usability, possibly make it into an android app
